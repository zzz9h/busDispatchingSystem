# busDispatchingSystem

The owners of this project are 沈原灏/李帛阳/焦稚雅， we worked together in BUPT's gitlab.

Unfortunately I have not found their github account, so I upload this project in my own repository.

From this project we build a bus dispatching system based on C/CPP.It contains three algorithms of dispatching:
- FCFS(First Come First Serve) Algorithm
- SSTF(SSTF-Shortest Seek Time First) Algorithm
- SCAN Algorithm

My task is to program the basic data structure and the second algorithm.

The project is currently planned to be divided into three additional branches
- 概要设计书
- OJ版代码 （to be completed）
- Qt动画版系统（to do）
